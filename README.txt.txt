Regarding Assignment VI:
-----------------------

	
    *  This readme file is intended to clear things out about how I went about this assignment.
      So below is a short description on how I completed this assignment.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Mainly this Assignment was given when we left school compound as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic. 
Thus the assignment was postponed until class restarts. but i had all the offline resources that I had gathered
before I left the school premesis. I had to clone the repository manually without internet connection and locally
within my pc. Thus I didnt clone using github. And It was done during quarintine at home where I had almost no 
internet connection and was unable to clone my repo from github. You can see the git log history for further detail.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   I chose this way, (1) Mainly Because I had no Internet connection at the time. and (2) This way seemed to be a
a better way in making the git log history as clear and separate from the previous version of the assignment (without
Bootstrap and Custom CSS).

Thank You!
